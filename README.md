# hyprland-config
**Note to anyone who somehow ended up here: Since I am currently not using hyprland on my desktop is almost all default (if it works at all)**  

(Arch Linux) Packages used: ```hyprland waybar wofi kitty hyprpaper xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland pavucontrol swaync kde-connect otf-font-awesome ttf-meslo-nerd cliphist pamixer nautilus network-manager-applet firefox keepassxc polkit-gnome polkit-kde-agent hypridle```  

(AUR) Packages used: ```hyprpicker hyprshot pamac-all wlogout syncthing-gtk```  

**Note for KeepassXC: When KeepassXC is set to run on start up the tray icon will not appear and only shows up after manually launching KeepassXC after hyprland starts up**

## How to apply my config (If you want to replicate my set up for some reason)
You could copy or move the files from the repo to your ``~/.config``  

For example (From ``~/hyprland-config/desktop`` to ``~/.config``):  

``cp -r ~/hyprland-config/desktop ~/.config``  or ``mv ~/hyprland-config/desktop ~/.config``  

Alternatively, you could also copy it to your ``~/.config`` graphically with your favorite file manager (Dolphin, Nautilus, Thunar, etc).
