## How to apply my config (If you want to replicate my set up for some reason)
You could copy or move the files from the repo to your ``~/.config``  

For example (From ``~/hyprland-config/desktop`` to ``~/.config``):  

``cp -r ~/hyprland-config/desktop ~/.config``  or ``mv ~/hyprland-config/desktop ~/.config``  

Alternatively, you could also copy it to your ``~/.config`` graphically with your favorite file manager (Dolphin, Nautilus, Thunar, Nemo, etc).
