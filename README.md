## How to apply my config (If you want to replecate my set up for some reason)
You could copy or move the files from the repo to your ``~/.config``  

For example (From ``~/hyprland-config/desktop`` to ``~/.config``):  

``cp -r ~/hyprland-config/desktop ~/.config``  or ``mv ~/hyprland-config/desktop ~/.config``  

Alterntatively, you could also do this graphically with your favorite file manager.
